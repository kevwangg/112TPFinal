The Project:
Title - A Totally Normal Shopping Trip
Description - The player must make it through a grocery store and collect all the food on their shopping list while avoiding zombies.
Easy mode - the zombies are slower and will not follow the player, instead ‘patrolling’ a lane. 
Hard mode part 1 - The zombies will chase the player if the player is in the lane the zombie is patrolling. 
Hard mode part 2 - When the player has completed the first shopping list and is then given more food to collect, the zombies will track the player using a modified version of Dijkstra’s algorithm.
